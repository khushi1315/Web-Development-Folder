flexbox is a one-dimensional layout method for laying out items in rows or columns.
Css flexbox is a better way to align items into a container.
flexbox=flexible+ box
syntax:
    p{ color: blue;}
    selector ,property, value
To make a box flebox you need to make container display: flex;
if parent container is flex then all items inside it will be flex items
after this you can apply flex properties.
width should be small or 100% instead of thousands of pixels for responsiveness otherwise wrap property will not be reflected.
use flex-flow for both direciton and wrap 
like thsi 
flex-flow: row wrap;
Justify content is gud property in this
also align items

ways to achieve responsiveness
1.Setting up the viewport1.

2.use max-width/max-height.
3.Using Css media queries.
4. using rem/vh/vw units over pixels
100vh takes height of whole page
100 vw takes width of whole page
